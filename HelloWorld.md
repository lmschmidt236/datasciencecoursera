```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document that I created for the Data Science Course One course project. 

I can use code chunks like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

Or I can also embed plots:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
